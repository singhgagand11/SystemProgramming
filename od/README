Project 01 - myod: clone of od

Compiling?
In order to compile the myod program one can simple type in the command line
"make myod" or "myod".
ex: $ make
ex: $ make myod

Running?
In order to run the program one has choice of typing three arguments:
-N, --read-bytes=BYTES
     limit dump to BYTES input bytes
-j, --skip-bytes=BYTES
     skip BYTES input bytes first
filename, --the file to dump into octal format
Note if filename is not provided od uses stdin for input.
ex: $ myod -j4 -N 20 file.txt
ex: myod -j4 file.txt

Thing I found out?
When od see's repeated characters it prints out a '*'.
